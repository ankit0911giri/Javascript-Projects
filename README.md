These all are my simple & basic HTML, TailwindCSS & JavaScript projects and for this you don't need to install any thing ( like tailwindcss ) because the files for styling is already included in all these folders so if you want to practise from scratch then my project gives you the best startup practise and you may modify this project to make it somewhat different but for making changes you must have to install tailwindcss and if you want to use plain css then you don't have to install tailwindcss like things. So, Enjoy your code. Thank you
